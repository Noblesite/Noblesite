# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathon Poe (a.k.a. Noblesite)

**Mobile Solutions Architect** & **Senior Software Engineer** with 15+ years of experience designing scalable enterprise mobility tools, automation platforms, and LLM-based assistant systems.

I specialize in:

- 🔐 Mobile Security (MDM/MAM – Intune, Workspace ONE, Knox)
- 📱 Native iOS & Android development
- 🔄 Enterprise automation (API integration, workflows, device diagnostics)
- 🧠 LLM-based tooling (QLoRA, LangChain, custom vector pipelines)

> ⚠️ **Actively publishing** refactored tools from my enterprise portfolio. Follow along as I surface, modernize, and document years of technical work.
