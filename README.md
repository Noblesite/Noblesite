# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathon Poe (a.k.a. Noblesite)

I'm a Mobile Solutions Architect and Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience designing and deploying enterprise mobile solutions at scale. I specialize in:

- 🔐 Mobile Security (MDM/MAM – Intune, Workspace ONE, Knox)
- 📱 Native iOS & Android development
- 🔄 Enterprise automation (API integration, device workflows)
- 🧠 Custom LLM workflows & AI tools
- 🔧 Diagnostic & migration utilities for mobile fleets

> ⚠️ **Refactoring in progress:** I'm actively reviewing, modernizing, and publishing both legacy and recent projects to GitHub. This portfolio is growing week by week as I surface and update the full scope of my work.
